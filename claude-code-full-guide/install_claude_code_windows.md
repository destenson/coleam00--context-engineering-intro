## Installing Claude Code on Windows (with WSL)

Claude Code only supports Linux and MacOS by default. To use Claude Code with Windows, you can use WSL.

1. Go to the Microsoft Store

2. Search for Ubuntu WSL and install

3. Open WSL in a terminal

4. Run the following commands (this follows best security practices):

```bash
# First, save a list of your existing global packages for later migration
npm list -g --depth=0 > ~/npm-global-packages.txt

# Create a directory for your global packages
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global

# Configure npm to use the new directory path
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global

# Note: Replace ~/.bashrc with ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or other appropriate file for your shell
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

# Apply the new PATH setting
source ~/.bashrc

# Now reinstall Claude Code in the new location
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

5. Now within your IDEs you can open a terminal with Ctrl + J (also use this hotkey to toggle it off) and you can click on the down arrow next to the plus to open an Ubuntu (WSL) terminal where you can run the "claude" command to start Claude Code.


## Installing Claude Code on Windows (without WSL)

Claude Code does work with Windows, you can use WSL or deno.

For Deno, you can install it from the official website: https://deno.land/

Follow the installation instructions for Windows, and then you can use Deno to install Claude Code from npm.

After installation, deno will complain loudly about permissions. You can give deno permissions by running the following command:

```bash
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net https://deno.land/x/claude_code/install.ts
```

You may want to change the claude launch command (found at `~/deno/bin/claude.cmd`, `%USERPROFILE%\deno\bin\claude.cmd`) to give deno all permissions by default:

```bash
% generated by deno install %
@deno "run" --allow-all "--no-config" "--lock" "C:\Users\deste\.deno\bin\.claude.lock.json" "npm:@anthropic-ai/claude-code" %*
```

Unfortunately, this is required for Deno to function properly with Claude Code. Since the posistion of the --allow argument is before the npm argument, it can't be included in the parameters passed to claude.
