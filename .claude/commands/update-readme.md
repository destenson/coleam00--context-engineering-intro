# Update README

Analyze the current project and update the README.md file based on the project's current state.

## Process

1. **Read the existing README.md** to understand the current documentation structure and content.

2. **Analyze the project structure** by examining:
   - Root directory files (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.)
   - Source code directories and key files
   - Configuration files
   - Scripts and build files
   - Documentation directories

3. **Identify gaps and outdated information** by comparing:
   - Documented dependencies vs actual dependencies
   - Described project structure vs current structure
   - Installation/setup instructions vs current requirements
   - Usage examples vs current functionality

4. **Update the README.md** with:
   - Accurate project description and purpose
   - Current installation and setup instructions
   - Updated usage examples and documentation
   - Current project structure overview
   - Recent changes or new features
   - Correct dependency information
   - Current development status
