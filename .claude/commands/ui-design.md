# UI Design

Design user interfaces with focus on usability, accessibility, and user experience.

## Design Scope: $ARGUMENTS

If $ARGUMENTS is provided, it may specify the type of interface (web, mobile, desktop), target users, or specific design requirements.

## Process

1. **Explore multiple design approaches and user perspectives**:
   - **User research**: Target audience analysis, user personas, use cases
   - **Platform considerations**: Web responsive, mobile native, desktop application, accessibility requirements
   - **Design philosophy**: Minimalist vs. rich interfaces, content-first vs. feature-rich
   - **Interaction patterns**: Touch vs. mouse/keyboard, voice interfaces, gesture controls
   - **Business constraints**: Branding requirements, technical limitations, timeline considerations
   - **Competitive analysis**: Industry standards, differentiation opportunities, best practices

2. **User experience and information architecture**:
   - **User journey mapping**: Key workflows, pain points, success metrics
   - **Information hierarchy**: Content organization, navigation structure, search and discovery
   - **Task flow analysis**: Primary actions, secondary features, error recovery paths
   - **Mental model alignment**: User expectations, familiar patterns, learning curve
   - **Accessibility requirements**: WCAG compliance, screen readers, keyboard navigation
   - **Performance considerations**: Load times, perceived performance, progressive enhancement

3. **Visual design and interface patterns**:
   - Use the TodoWrite tool to plan design system and component strategy
   - **Design system foundation**: Color palette, typography, spacing, iconography
   - **Component library**: Buttons, forms, navigation, cards, modals, data display
   - **Layout patterns**: Grid systems, responsive breakpoints, flexible layouts
   - **Visual hierarchy**: Typography scale, color contrast, white space usage
   - **Brand integration**: Logo placement, brand colors, voice and tone alignment

4. **Responsive and adaptive design**:
   - **Breakpoint strategy**: Mobile-first vs. desktop-first approach
   - **Content prioritization**: Progressive disclosure, adaptive content
   - **Touch and interaction design**: Touch targets, gestures, hover states
   - **Performance optimization**: Image optimization, lazy loading, critical CSS
   - **Cross-browser compatibility**: Fallbacks, progressive enhancement, polyfills

5. **Accessibility and inclusive design**:
   - **WCAG compliance**: Color contrast, alt text, keyboard navigation, focus management
   - **Screen reader support**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, proper heading structure
   - **Motor accessibility**: Large touch targets, alternative input methods
   - **Cognitive accessibility**: Clear language, error prevention, help text
   - **Testing with assistive technology**: Screen readers, voice control, switch navigation

6. **Prototyping and validation**:
   - **Design tools**: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD for high-fidelity mockups
   - **Prototyping**: Interactive prototypes, micro-interactions, animation design
   - **User testing**: Usability testing, A/B testing, accessibility testing
   - **Design handoff**: Developer specifications, asset generation, design tokens
   - **Implementation validation**: Design QA, cross-device testing, performance impact

## Design Considerations by Platform

### Web Interface Design
- Responsive grid systems and flexible layouts
- Progressive web app capabilities
- Browser compatibility and graceful degradation
- SEO considerations and semantic markup
- Web accessibility standards and screen reader support

### Mobile Application Design
- Platform-specific design guidelines (iOS/Android)
- Touch interaction patterns and gesture support
- Device-specific features (camera, GPS, sensors)
- Performance optimization for mobile devices
- App store guidelines and approval considerations

### Desktop Application Design
- Window management and multi-window support
- Keyboard shortcuts and power user features
- Menu systems and toolbar organization
- File system integration and drag-and-drop
- Platform-specific UI conventions

## Modern UI Design Patterns

### Design Systems and Component Libraries
- Atomic design methodology
- Design tokens for consistency
- Component documentation and usage guidelines
- Version control for design assets

### Interaction Design
- Micro-interactions and feedback
- Animation principles and performance
- State management and loading states
- Error handling and recovery flows

### Content and Layout Strategies
- Content-first design approach
- Progressive disclosure techniques
- Scannable content and information hierarchy
- White space and visual breathing room

## Output

Provide comprehensive UI design package including:
- **Design Strategy**: Overall approach, user research insights, design principles
- **Information Architecture**: Site map, user flows, navigation structure
- **Visual Design System**: Color palette, typography, iconography, component library
- **Interface Mockups**: High-fidelity designs for key screens and interactions
- **Responsive Specifications**: Breakpoint behavior, adaptive content strategy
- **Accessibility Documentation**: WCAG compliance checklist, testing procedures
- **Design Tokens**: CSS variables, design system specifications for developers
- **Implementation Guidelines**: Design handoff specifications, animation details
- **Testing Plan**: Usability testing approach, validation criteria, success metrics
