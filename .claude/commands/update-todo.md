# Update TODO

Scan codebase for TODO/FIXME comments and update the project TODO list.

## Process

1. **Scan for TODO items** in code:
   - Search for TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX, NOTE comments
   - Check issue trackers or project management tools
   - Review recent commit messages for mentioned tasks

2. **Categorize and prioritize**:
   - Group by urgency (critical, high, medium, low)
   - Group by component/area (frontend, backend, docs, etc.)
   - Identify dependencies between tasks

3. **Update TODO.md** with:
   - Current high-priority items
   - Technical debt items
   - Feature requests or enhancements
   - Bug fixes needed
   - Documentation updates required
   - Remove completed items

4. **Cross-reference** with:
   - Recent project changes
   - Known issues or limitations
   - Planned features or roadmap

## Output

Provide updated TODO.md content organized by priority and category, with file references where applicable.
